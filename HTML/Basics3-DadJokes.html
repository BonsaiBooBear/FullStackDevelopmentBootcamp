            <br>Dad Joke Epidemic Addressed by UN</h1>

        <p><strong>REPORTS ARE COMING IN FROM AROUND THE WORLD:</strong> The number of delivered Dad Jokes has reached record-breaking highs, with no signs of slowing down. The United Nations Secretary-General called an emergency assembly this morning to address the crisis at hand, and a bold and actionable solution was proposed.</p>
        <hr>

        <h2>The Nature of the Dad Joke</h2>
        <p>Dad jokes are typically characterized by their ability to elicit audible groans through use of wordplay. Some are even considered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-humor" target="_blank">anti-jokes</a>, and derive humor from intentionally non-humorous punchlines.</p>
        <p>Delivered by fathers, father figures, and the occasional rogue uncle, these jokes are typically followed by the phrase: "Haha, get it?"</p>

        <h2>Societal Impact</h2>
        <p>While seemingly harmless, dad jokes have been known to cause temporary embarrassment, forced laughter, and in extreme cases, immunity to humor. Shocking first-hand accounts, like those below, were considered during the UN Emergency Assembly.
        <br><br><strong>NOTE:</strong> Sources are kept anonymous due to privacy and protection laws.
        </p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>Middle School Daughter</td>
                <td>"He just wouldn't stop! I had friends over for dinner, and I almost DIED from embarrassment! Cringe was served as a main course, and it was horrifying."</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>High School Junior</td>
                <td>"Dude, the teachers just don't know when to quit. If I have I have to hear 'I used to be a baker, but I couldn't make enough dough' one more time, I'm gonna hurl."</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>The Proposal</h2>
        <p>In order to preserve the delicate balance of humor and dignity, it has been proposed that dad jokes be formally recognized as a critically endangered form of comedic expression. A new licensing system shall be introduced, wherein individuals must pass a Pun Proficiency Qualification Exam before delivering jokes such as:
        <br><br>"What do you call a flock of birds that stick together? Vel-crows!"<br><br>
        Illegal punning, or telling dad jokes without an valid license, will result in a $5,000 fine and up to 6 years in federal imprisonment. </p>

        <h2>Implementation Strategy</h2>
        <p>A new law will be introduced to regulate Dad Jokes. It will be known as D-Law. Under D-Law:
            <ol>
                <li>Jokes <strong>MUST</strong> be approved by a locally certified Groan Council.</li>
                <li>Joke submissions must be received by the council 24 hours prior to desired date of joke delivery.</li>
                <li>If approved, the applicant will receive a temporary "Dad License," valid for 3 days.</li>
                <li>The applicant will then be allowed to perform in a designated Dad Joke Delivery Zone. These zones will be established in public parks, hardware stores, and car dealerships.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>Violaters of D-Law who misuse puns in unauthorized contexts will be subject to:
            <ul>                
                <li>Up to a $5,000 fine</li>
                <li>Up to 30 days in Dad Jail</li>
                <li>Up to 9 months of Community Service
                    <br>Note: Will include reading knock-knock jokes to toddlers until they giggle.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Though dangerous if unregulated, dad jokes have become a vital part of our cultural fabric. With the proper regulation, training, and respect this proposal introduces, future generations just may be able to experience the joy of hearing:
        <br><br>“What's brown and sticky? A stick.”</p>
