        <h1>Proposal Regarding the Dad Joke Epidemic</h1>
        <p>REPORTS ARE COMING IN FROM AROUND THE WORLD: The number of delivered Dad Jokes has reached record-breaking highs, with no signs of slowing down. The United Nations Secretary-General called an emergency assembly this morning to address the crisis at hand, and a bold and actionable solution was proposed.</p>
        <hr>

        <h2>The Nature of the Dad Joke</h2>
        <p>Dad jokes are typically characterized by their ability to elicit audible groans through use of wordplay. Delivered by fathers, father figures, and the occasional rogue uncle, these jokes are typically followed by the phrase "Haha, get it?"</p>

        <h2>Societal Impact</h2>
        <p>While seemingly harmless, dad jokes have been known to cause temporary embarrassment, forced laughter, and in extreme cases, immunity to humor. First-hand accounts have been submitted, by those affected. One witness (who wished to remain anonymous), gave an excruciating account of the suffering they incurred at a family dinner:
        <br><br>"Cringe was served as a main course. It was horrible."<br><br>
        Classrooms have also been afflicted with teachers who open their lesson with:
        <br><br>"I used to be a baker, but I couldn't make enough dough."</p>

        <h2>The Proposal</h2>
        <p>In order to preserve the delicate balance of humor and dignity, it is proposed that dad jokes be formally recognized as a critically endangered form of comedic expression. A new licensing system shall be introduced, wherein individuals must pass a Pun Proficiency Qualification Exam before delivering jokes such as
        <br><br>"What do you call a flock of birds that stick together? Vel-crows!"<br><br>
        Illegal punning, or telling dad jokes without an valid license, will result in a $5,000 fine and up to 6 years in federal imprisonment. </p>

        <h2>Implementation Strategy</h2>
        <p>Dad Joke Delivery Zones will be established in public parks, hardware stores, and car dealerships. Jokes must be approved by a locally certified Groan Council and submitted for review, 24 hours prior to delivery date. Repeat licensed offenders who misuse puns in unauthorized contexts will be sentenced to community service, which will include reading knock-knock jokes to toddlers until they giggle.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Though dangerous if unregulated, dad jokes have become a vital part of our cultural fabric. With the proper regulation, training, and respect this proposal introduces, future generations just may be able to experience the joy of hearing:
        <br><br>“What's brown and sticky? A stick.”</p>
